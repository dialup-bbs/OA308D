# OA308D
All Discrete LM308 Op-Amp - The rare, classic and out of print LM308 Op-Amp using all discrete components.

Based on detailed schematic as presented in Linear Technology datasheet. Transistor component reference numbers are the same.

This is an untested work in progress. Any corrections, feedback, comments or recommendations are highly encouraged. I seriously have zero idea what I'm doing.

This project is totally influenced by MostlyDIYrf/K7TFC's OA741D.
