# OA308D
All Discrete LM308 Op-Amp - The rare, classic and out of print LM308 Op-Amp using all discrete components.

Based on detailed schematic as presented in the Linear Technology datasheet. Transistor component reference numbers are the same.

This is an untested work in progress. Please do not build if you do not know what you are doing. Three prototype boards are currently under fabrication. Any corrections, feedback, comments or recommendations are highly encouraged.

This is also my second KiCad project and as a builder, I am completely unexperienced as a circuit drafter/designer.

This project is totally influenced by MostlyDIYrf/K7TFC's OA741D.
